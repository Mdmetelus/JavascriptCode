  <h1 class = "gold">Lambda Is Awesome!!!</h1>
  <h2>Who wouldn't want to learn to code here?</h2>
  <p>I'm Max, and I've been passionate about code for a few years but have not yet gotten the opportunity to focus on it in this kind of environment. </p>
  <p>When i'm not coding I like to tinker with computers and operating systems in linux. I also enjoy assembling computers, and modified both labtops and desktops.</p>
</div>
<div Class = "Last">
  <h2 class = "gold" >Coding is my primary passion!</h2>
  <h4>I also have other passions and hobbies.</h4>
  <p>Some of my other passions include painting and drawing, sports,and fitness. I'm constantly reading a believe learning is a lifelong process. I love spirituality, music,architecture, and anything beautiful. I hope to write clean, and bueautiful code some day!</p>
  <p>I enjoy spending time with my friends and family and the simple pleasures life has to offer when time allows.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Education is important to Me.</h2>
  <h4>I've attended other schools.</h4>
  <p>I went to Queens College and enjoyed my time there completing a BA in Economics.</p>
  <p>I also attended WGU where i plan to complete my a Masters In Business Admin.</p>
  <p class = "gold" >That being said, I believe what a person does with what they learn and know is significantly more important that the knowing iteself.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your time. Have a nice Day.</p>

  <h2 Class = "gold" >Exercise I - Reflection:</h2>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>1.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">It means you have technical experience, the ability to learn on your own and from your peers. You can solve problems, apply logic, and creativity at the same time. You can work with groups of people and contribute to a team.
I  have most of these qualities except the technical expertise, but I want to improve both my strengths and weaknesses. I know there is so much I can learn from and share with other people.</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>2.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">I want to finally learn a bit about CSS because I've never been exposed to it yet. I also want to get a better idea of the teaching style offered and how it may be different than what I've thus far experienced.
 I've learned from udemy, youtube, school, freecodecamp, and on my own. Your organization seems like a more professional outfit; Something more in line with a real-world workflow. I need to experience with that as much as I need to develop my coding skills.</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>3.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">Complete the Lamda school program, then Look for employment as a  software developer. Contribute to open source projects in my spare time. If I don't get into Lambda, I will continue working on solo-learn, freecodecamp, udemy, and a number of other learning platforms I already use and build a professional portfolio.   I can find then professional employment.</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>4.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">I know that I am good at finding creative solutions to solving problems. I am accustomed to learning in my free time for fun. I like to work hard.  I experience coding as being more play than work in the sense of enjoyment of what I'm doing while completing tasks and projects, even when I'm completely bewildered.</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>5.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">I think it will be a challenge to adjust to the pace of Lambda boot camp leaning style and I look forward to this. Learning by immersion is the best way to maximize competence in the least amount of time.
I think I'll be challenged by unit tests, integration tests, and test-driven development as I have zero knowledge, nor experience with these topics. I also think mastering algorithm optimization and implementation will be a big challenge even though I've independently reviewed many of the basic concepts and find them very interesting.</p>

  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>6.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">I knew nothing about CSS before this class... time, effort, and Google can be very helpful.lol</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>7.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">On the lambdaschool.com site front page, it is cool to see text and pictures, and animations, that appear from blank space only when it is scrolled over. I assume that must be JS integrated into the page. (Speaking of the slack  section near the bottom of the page.)</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>8.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">I could not say, this is not in my current wheelhouse.</p>

  <h1 class = "gold" >Exercise II - Inspect a Website.</h1>
  <h3>I chose to inspect Youtube!</h3>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>1.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">Yes, i found Headers, and divs, but no P's.</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>2.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">  I chose the "iframe" element because i have never seen it before.The HTML Inline Frame element, it represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page. You can include any number of them into elements within a document, each of which embeds another document inside the body of a page. Now thats cool.</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>3.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">Some elements could not be changed others could be broken my me very easily. lol.</p>
  <h4 Class = "silver">Answer Number <span>4.</span></h4>
  <p Class = "bronze">HTML has more intricacy than I previously assumed.</p>
