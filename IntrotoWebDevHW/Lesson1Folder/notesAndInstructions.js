Exercise I - Reflection
Time: 20 minutes

**********ALL ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS ARE IN THE HTML CODE, AND OUTPUT!!!!***********

1) What does it mean to be a software engineer? Which of those qualities do you already have?

2) What do you hope to get out of the Lambda School Mini Bootcamp?

3) What are your long term programming goals?

4) What parts of programming do you think you'll be good at?

5) What part of programming do you think will be a challenge?

6) Explain something that you didn't know about programming or web development before tonight.

7) Pick a web app or web site you frequently use. What is an specific example of how that app or site uses HTML? CSS? Javascript? Example: If you picked lambdaschool.com you might say the "See How It Works" button text is an example of HTML. The red color of the button is an example of CSS. The way the color slightly changes when you hover the mouse is an example of JS.

8) Using the same app or site from question 7, what were some challenges the programmers may have faced when developing it?


Exercise II - Inspect a Website.
Time: 20 minutes

Pick a website you frequently use and open it the broswer. Right click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect". A side bar will appear that says "Elements". This is all the HTML that went into that specific webpage.

1) Can you find a header, div, and p somewhere on the webpage?

2) Find an HTML element you have not learned about yet. Explain what it is and how it's used. Use Google to help answer this question.

3) If you double click an element you can edit it. Change the tag on a few different elements on the screen. What happens? Note: Some element cannot be edited, so try sticking with a div, p, or header if you're having trouble with this question.

4) How does this exercise either support or change the ways you were thinking about HTML?

Once you are done with these exercises, drag open the HTML screen to the left, and drag up the screen below this and complete Exercise III.
